    "`Pyrosm` aims to be an easy-to-use and fast Python tool for parsing OpenStreetMap data from Protocolbuffer Binary Format (PBF) files into [geopandas](http://geopandas.org/) which is the Python's go-to library for working with spatial data. Pyrosm has been written mainly in Cython (Python with C-like performance) which makes it probably faster than any other Python alternatives for parsing OpenStreetMap data. Pyrosm is built on top of another Cython library called Pyrobuf which is a faster Cython alternative to Google’s Protobuf library: It provides 2-4x boost in performance for deserializing the protocol buffer messages compared to Google’s version with C++ backend. Google’s Protocol Buffers is a commonly used and efficient method to serialize and compress structured data which is also used by OpenStreetMap contributors to distribute the OSM data in PBF format (Protocolbuffer Binary Format). In addition, Pyrosm uses extensively Numpy array operations and parses geometries using Pygeos which are both excellent choises for fast and memory efficient data manipulation in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the performance of Pyrosm, here pyrosm is compared against other similar tools. There are various tools available for parsing OSM data (such as Osmosis, Osmium-tool, esy-osm-pbf, osmread), however, most of them are not easy to use, they are not for Python, or they are hard to install with all operating systems. The most similar tool to Pyrosm is [OSMnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx) which makes it possible to retrieve OpenStreetMap data easily into GeoDataFrames utilizing OverPass API (it also inspired building this one!). Hence, the comparisons and benchmarking are done between Pyrosm and OSMnx. In the tests, we benchmark the time it takes to retrievie different datasets for Helsinki Region, Finland. We also test how long it takes to parse data covering large geographical areas such as the state of New York. \n",

After the first call, all the other calls (with the same initialized `OSM` instance) are read and parsed directly from the memory, which is very fast. OSMnx also supports caching, meaning that if you make identical calls, OSMnx does not necessarily fetch the data another time from the API. However, if you make a slight change to the call, OSMnx needs to make a new API call to OverPass API, whereas Pyrosm uses the same raw data dump once initialized.  \n",

Whereas OSMnx works all over the world straight from the box, with Pyrosm it is currently needed to separately download the data (and possibly even cropped) from Geofabrik before you can get the speed benefits of the tool. Pyrosm has a few test datasets (see `pyrosm.data.available`) available that can be used easily, but in the future, the hope is to add support for clipping the PBF data by a bounding box and saving the extract into a new PBF (similarly as Osmosis/Osmium-tool does now). After this, it would be possible to add automatic download of PBF data in a similar manner as currently in OSMnx.  "
